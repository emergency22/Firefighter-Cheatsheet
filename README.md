## Synopsis

<img src="resources/images/mainPage.PNG">

Firefighter Cheatsheet is my personal capstone project at Nashville Software School within the Software Engineering Program Cohort #1.

Firefighter Cheatsheet is a website application that allows firefighters to set up an account via AWS Cognito to track fire trucks (apparatus) and hoses, and generate a handy customized cheat sheet of calculated pump pressures for each fire hose.

## Lessons Learned

My biggest takeaway from this project is to work on the front-end and back-end simultaneously. I feel that I was able to problem-solve more quickly in this manner as neither side was "siloed," but rather built in conjunction. I also feel that focusing my work locally and leaving the deployment as a last step also helped to speed the development.

I learned a lot and feel much more comfortable with Javascript, CSS, and HTML, as well how RESTFUL web services function under the hood.
